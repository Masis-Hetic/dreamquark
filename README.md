#### We want to create a user management system
   
## Features

- Create a user with an email, a name
- Create user organizations (hierarchical relation)
- Create user teams (a team is composed of users from any organizations)
- View them in any way you want
- View a user
- View the links between users (optional)
   
## Rules
   
- An API and a Web application

- Don't hesitate to take shortcuts
